    shader would then color each pixel of a polygon by interpolating
    between the colors of the three vertices.

    The closest fragments to vertex A get the color of it, 
    the closesr to vertex B get the colornof B, 
    the color interpolates between the 2.

Varying object colours (or other attributes) within a single batch / draw call.
Position is one -optional - aspect of that data blob we call Vertex.
a triangle gets colored based on their vertices' color information. 
  add uv coordinates to draw a texture on that triangle. 
It's an easy way to add colors to a model without using a texture.
skeletal weights so you can animate the mesh more easily
vertex attributes shown as colors for easier perception.

confusion is because of the frequent conflating of terms “vertex” and “position” in 3D/graphics. 
   A mesh vertex is really just a chunk of data that's processed at the vertex stage of rendering.
   Vertex colors aren't that relevant when you have a fully textured 3d mesh. 
But it gets interesting when you have an untextured but colored mesh.
